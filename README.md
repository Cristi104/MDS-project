# Time Echo

## Description
Time Echo is a puzzle-platformer where players manipulate time by working alongside their past selves. Each failed attempt creates an "echo"—a ghostly replay of the player's last actions. By strategically planning movements and utilizing multiple echoes, players must solve increasingly complex puzzles to escape time loops and reach the exit.

## Core Mechanics
• Time Loop System – Every failed attempt spawns an AI-controlled version of the player's past self that repeats previous actions.

• Echo Interaction – Players can use their echoes to activate buttons to move doors or platforms.

• Challenging Puzzles – Levels require strategic planning, precise movement, and clever use of past actions.

• Minimalist Visuals & Atmospheric Soundtrack – A clean and immersive design that enhances the time-looping experience.

## Why It's Unique
Unlike traditional platformers, Time Echo forces players to think ahead, using their own past attempts as tools rather than obstacles.
